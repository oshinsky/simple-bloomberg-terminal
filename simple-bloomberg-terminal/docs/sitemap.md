| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("fetch")]` |
| View | Views/Companies/Create.cshtml (returned as view name "Create") |
| Parameters | symbol: string? (form) |
| Notes | Prefills the New Company form from the Financial Modeling Prep API by ticker symbol, then returns the Create view with the mapped model for review before the user submits the normal `POST /companies/create`. Persists nothing itself |

---

## /companies/discover-private

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | DiscoverPrivate |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("discover-private")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | Views/Companies/Create.cshtml (returned as view name "Create") |
| Parameters | name: string (form) |
| Notes | The "PRIVATE · AI" tab of the New Company page: web-searches (Perplexity sonar) a private company's profile by name and returns the Create view prefilled with Type=PRIVATE plus AI-estimated sector/industry/country/description and estimated revenue & gross margin, for the user to review before submitting the normal `POST /companies/create`. Persists nothing itself |

---

## /companies/backfill

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Backfill |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("backfill")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ filled:[{name,ticker,rows,source}], failed:[{name,ticker,reason}], rateLimited:bool, remaining:int, message }`) |
| Parameters | — |
| Notes | Bulk-refreshes existing companies from the real APIs: resolves a ticker from each company's SEC CIK (via the SEC company_tickers.json map), skips companies that already have FMP-sourced financials, then re-runs the profile+financials fetch (overwriting AI-seeded profile fields and replacing the dated CompanyFinancial history). Stops cleanly when FMP's daily quota (HTTP 429) is reached so a later run resumes. Driven by the "⟳ BACKFILL FROM APIs" button + results modal on the Companies index page |

---

## /companies/backfill/ciks

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | BackfillCiks |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("backfill/ciks")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ jobId }` — starts a detached background backfill job, no redirect; results render in the existing Companies/Index backfill popup) |
| Parameters | — |
| Notes | Sibling to `backfill/financials` and `backfill/industries`. Launches a detached `BackfillJob` (registered in the singleton in-memory `BackfillJobStore`) that assigns SEC CIKs to US companies missing one (FMP returns null for some US filers) by matching each company's name against the SEC ticker map — a fast, quota-free pure name match needing no FMP/LLM keys. Returns the `jobId` at once; the popup polls `backfill/{id}/status` for live per-company progress + the final summary, and the close button cancels via `backfill/{id}/cancel` |

---

## /companies/{id}/profile

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Details |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/profile")]` |
| View | Views/Companies/Details.cshtml |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |

---

## /companies/{id}/edit

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Edit |
| HTTP | GET, POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/edit")]` |
| View | Views/Companies/Edit.cshtml |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained); form fields (POST) |
| Notes | The form exposes a GICS Sub-Industry select that is authoritative — when set, Industry + Sector roll up from it (the coarser Sector/Industry picks are ignored); cleared, they fall back to the explicit Sector/Industry. A "Lock classification" checkbox pins the row so the backfill/AI re-resolve leaves it alone. Changing the sub-industry forgets the row's cached FMP-label mapping so a wrong/ambiguous label can't keep mis-classifying others |

---

## /companies/{id}/rediscover

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Rediscover |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/rediscover")]` (named route `CompanyRediscover`, ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ jobId }`, HTTP 200 — fire-and-forget, no redirect) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | Asynchronous re-discovery for an existing PRIVATE company: registers a detached `RediscoverJob` in the singleton in-memory `RediscoverJobStore`, then fires the Perplexity `sonar-pro` profile discovery + mapping + save (overwriting profile fields and re-stamping the single estimated financial row) on a background `Task.Run` with a fresh DI scope, and returns the `jobId` at once so the request doesn't block. Public companies are rejected with 400 BadRequest; missing company → 404. Triggered by the "RE-DISCOVER (PERPLEXITY)" button on the Details view (Views/Companies/Details.cshtml) for private companies; the browser hands the `jobId` to the bottom-right notification widget, which polls `GET /extraction/scan-jobs`. When the job finishes, if the user is still on that company's Details page it auto-reloads to show the updated profile + financials |

---

## /companies/{id}/linked-sources

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | LinkedSources |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/linked-sources")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ owned, inverse }` arrays of `{ kind, direction, id, name, type, value, other }`) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | The company's active revenue/cost sources in two groups: `owned` (CompanyId == id — these block deletion) and `inverse` (RelatedCompanyId == id — owned by other companies). Feeds the linked-sources delete popup on the Companies index page. Returns 404 when the company is not found |

---

## /companies/{id}/delete

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Delete |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/delete")]` (named route `CompanyDelete`) |
| View | — (soft-delete; returns status codes, not a redirect) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | Driven by fetch in site.js, so it returns 200 OK on success and 409 Conflict (with the blocking message) when active linked sources prevent deletion, rather than redirecting |

---

## /companies/{id}/ingest-volume

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | IngestVolume |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/ingest-volume")]` (named route `CompanyIngestVolume`, Authorize, ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ count, series }`) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | Ingests the company's weekly trading-volume history from Yahoo Finance (range=max) and stores it, then returns the stored series. Triggered by the "INGEST VOLUME (YAHOO)" button on the Company Details page (Views/Companies/Details.cshtml) to populate the weekly volume graph next to the Financial Overview / COMPANY DATA card. Returns 404 when the company is not found; 422 when the company has no SEC ticker (non-US) or Yahoo returns no data |

---

## /companies/classification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Classification |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("classification")]` (`[AllowAnonymous]`) |
| View | Views/Companies/Classification.cshtml |
| Parameters | — |
| Notes | The classification review: a table of EVERY active company showing its raw FMP source label beside the resolved Sector / Industry / Sub-industry, so a human can catch a confident mis-fit (which is marked Resolved and never appears on `/companies/unclassified`). Rows whose normalized FMP label resolved to more than one distinct sub-industry across the book are flagged (ambiguous/colliding label the cache can't disambiguate); flagged rows sort first, then by sector then name. Renders `List<ClassificationRow>`. Client-side filters: All / Unclassified / Flagged. Each row offers a "✦ AI" re-resolve (POSTs to `/companies/{id}/reclassify`) and an EDIT link. Linked from the "⚑ CLASSIFICATION" link on the Companies index page (Views/Companies/Index.cshtml) — it replaced the old "⚑ UNCLASSIFIED" link, though `/companies/unclassified` still exists |

---

## /companies/unclassified

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Unclassified |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("unclassified")]` (`[AllowAnonymous]`) |
| View | Views/Companies/Unclassified.cshtml |
| Parameters | — |
| Notes | The Unclassified report: lists every active company with no resolved GICS sub-industry, NoFit first (the genuine misses the backfill flagged) then Pending, sorted by name. Each row offers a "Resolve with AI" action that POSTs to `/companies/{id}/reclassify`. The Companies index page no longer links here directly (its "⚑ CLASSIFICATION" link now points at `/companies/classification`), but the route remains live |

---

## /companies/{id}/reclassify

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController |
| Action | Reclassify |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("companies")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/reclassify")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ resolved, status, sector, industry, subIndustry }`) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | On-demand AI re-resolve of one company's GICS sub-industry (the "Resolve with AI" button on the Unclassified page). Runs inline on the user's own keys (FMP label fetch + the cheap classifier); the classifier swallows a missing key and returns null, so a key-less account sees "couldn't place" rather than an error. Returns the fresh classification (AJAX, called from `/companies/unclassified`) so the row updates in place. Returns 404 when the company is not found |

---

## /events/feed

| Field | Value |

| Notes | Sets which filing backs the row — upserted by accession, so a filing only browsed from EDGAR is created on the fly; a blank accession clears the link |

## /revenue-sources/{id}/edit

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | RevenueSourcesController |
| Action | Edit |
| HTTP | GET, POST |
| Route source | `[Route("revenue-sources")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/edit")]` |
| View | Views/RevenueSources/Edit.cshtml |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained); form fields (POST); returnUrl: string? (query, POST) |
| Notes | POST also accepts an optional `returnUrl` and redirects there if it is a local URL (so the breakdown page's inline edit returns to itself); otherwise redirects to Index |

---

## /revenue-sources/{id}/delete

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | RevenueSourcesController |
| Action | Delete |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("revenue-sources")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/delete")]` |

## /indices

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | IndicesController |
| Action | Index |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("indices")]` + `[Route("")]` (`[AllowAnonymous]`) |
| View | Views/Indices/Index.cshtml |
| Parameters | — |
| Notes | Returns an `IndicesPageViewModel` (indices + recent import jobs) instead of `IEnumerable<StockIndex>`. Lists the tracked `StockIndex` rows grouped by sector and sorted by size (Σ member market cap), plus the recent import jobs. The old `ViewBag.Catalog` of hardcoded one-click import indices has been removed — there are no longer hardcoded catalog import buttons |

---

## /indices/{id}/breakdown

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | IndicesController |
| Action | Details |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("indices")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/breakdown")]` (`[AllowAnonymous]`) |
| View | Views/Indices/Details.cshtml |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | Shows the index's sector + industry breakdown — grouped live from each member's `Company.Sector` / `Company.Industry`, weighted by the stored per-member `IndexConstituent.WeightPct` — plus the constituent list. ViewModel: `IndexDetailViewModel`. Returns 404 when the index is not found |

---

## /indices/discover

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | IndicesController |
| Action | Discover (async) |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("indices")]` + `[Route("discover")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON array of DiscoveredIndex: code, name, wikiPage, region, sector, etf_ticker) |
| Parameters | query: string (form); ct: CancellationToken |
| Auth | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` (class-level) |
| Notes | Web-searches the stock-market indices matching a free-text query via Perplexity sonar (`IIndexDiscovery`). Each suggestion carries its English-Wikipedia constituents-page path plus a sector and ETF ticker so the page can render one-click import buttons that POST to `/indices/import`. Persists nothing. 400 if query blank; 424 if the user has no Perplexity key |

---

## /indices/import

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | IndicesController |
| Action | Import |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("indices")]` + `[Route("import")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ jobId }` — starts a detached background import job, no redirect) |
| Parameters | code: string?, name: string?, wikiPage: string?, etfTicker: string?, sector: string?, region: string? (all form) |
| Auth | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` |
| Notes | Starts a detached background import job (registered in the in-memory `IndexImportJobStore`) and returns its `jobId` at once so the slow Wikipedia scrape / SPDR fetch + SEC map can't time out the request; the page polls `import/{jobId}/status`. Routes to the SPDR holdings source for real weights when an ETF ticker is known, else scrapes Wikipedia membership (cap-weighted). Used by both the Perplexity-discovered suggestion buttons (code+wikiPage+sector+etfTicker) and the manual SPDR ETF import box (etfTicker only). 400 if neither a code nor an ETF ticker is provided |

---

## /indices/import/{id}/continue

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | IndicesController |
| Action | Continue (async) |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("indices")]` + `[Route("import/{id:long}/continue", Name = "StockIndexImportContinue")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ jobId }` — flips the job to Running and re-runs the detached import, no redirect) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Auth | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` (class-level) |
| Notes | Continues a job whose FMP auto-provisioning was cut short (Partial) — or retries one that errored — under THIS user's API keys. Re-runs the stored `IndexImportRequest`: existing members re-link for free via the SEC CIK map, and only the still-missing members spend the continuing user's FMP quota. Any authorized user may continue any user's job (stamps `ContinuedBy`). Returns 404 when the job id is unknown; 400 when the job is already Running |

---

## /indices/import/{id}/status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | IndicesController |
| Action | ImportStatus |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("indices")]` + `[Route("import/{id:long}/status")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ status, progress, indexId, message, error }`) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Auth | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` (class-level) |
| Notes | Polls one import job's live status. The page polls it to show progress and, on success, link to the breakdown (`indices/{indexId}/breakdown`) of the index that was just imported. Returns 404 when the job id is unknown |

---

## /indices/{id}/delete

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | IndicesController |
| Action | Delete |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("indices")]` + `[Route("{id:long}/delete", Name = "StockIndexDelete")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (soft-delete, redirects to Index) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Auth | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` |
| Notes | Soft-deletes the index and redirects to Index |

---

## /extraction

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | Index |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("")]` |
| View | Views/Extraction/Index.cshtml |
| Parameters | companyId: long? (query string, optional); revenueSourceId: long? (query string, optional — REVENUE deep-link prefill only); node: string? (query string, optional — `REVENUE`\|`COST`\|`RISK`, default `REVENUE`) |
| Notes | Split-screen extraction UI — company autocomplete picker plus a Node dropdown (Revenue/Cost/Risk) that drives SEC Item routing, prompts, and the saved entity. The right pane browses primary SEC filings; selected filing text becomes Evidence. `?revenueSourceId=` deep-links an existing RevenueSource row. The page JS also reads `accession`, `doc`, `form`, and `jobId` from the query string to rehydrate a filing/scan context. |

---

## /extraction/references/{sourceId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | References |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("references/{sourceId:long}")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ reference, evidence, filing }` — filing is a "Form Accession" label, null when the row cites none or it was soft-deleted) |
| Parameters | sourceId: long (route, constrained); node: string (query, required — `REVENUE`\|`COST`\|`RISK`; picks which source table the id resolves against) |
| Notes | The proof already on a source row, so the extraction page can fill its Reference/Evidence boxes when it binds the row. Returns 404 when the source row id is not found for the given node |

---

## /extraction/reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | Reference |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("reference")]` |
| View | — (JSON `ReferenceResult` record: SourceId) |
| Parameters | JSON body (ReferenceRequest): companyId, sourceId?, node (`REVENUE`\|`COST`\|`RISK`, required), classification, name, value, percentage, note (RISK rows), relatedCompanyId, reference, evidence, filingAccessionNumber?, filingForm?, filingDate?, filingUrl? |
| Notes | Sets one row's proof: upserts the node's source row (RevenueSource / CostSource / CompanyRisk; create if new, DataSource=MANUAL) with its `reference` + `evidence`, plus the `FilingId` when filing metadata is supplied. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (missing companyId/name/evidence, or invalid classification); 404 (source row id not found). Superseded in the UI by `POST /extraction/save` (endpoint still present but no longer called) |

---

## /extraction/save

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | Save |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("save")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ sourceId, proof }` — `proof` is true when an evidence quote was sent) |
| Parameters | JSON body (SaveRequest): companyId, sourceId?, node (`REVENUE`\|`COST`\|`RISK`, required), classification, name, value, percentage, note, relatedCompanyId, reference, evidence, filingAccessionNumber?, filingForm?, filingDate?, filingUrl? |
| Notes | Current UI save path — saves the whole extraction form in one request: `node` selects which entity the row upserts into (RevenueSource / CostSource / CompanyRisk; `note` backs RISK rows), and the row's single proof (reference + evidence + the filing upserted from the sent accession) is written with it. An omitted reference/evidence/filing keeps whatever citation the row already carries. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (bad companyId / missing name / invalid node or classification) |

---

## /extraction/save-batch

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | SaveBatch (async) |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("save-batch")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ saved, links }`) |
| Parameters | JSON body — { companyId, node, accession, form, items:[{ name, classification, value, percentage, note, relatedCompany, relatedCompanyTicker, reference, evidence }] } |
| Notes | Batch-saves multiple AI-proposed objects in one call from the notification widget's chat (the user ticks which `​```save```​` blocks to keep). The batch's filing is upserted once by accession; each item then upserts its source row (RevenueSource / CostSource / CompanyRisk) with its own `reference` + `evidence` and that FilingId. Items that name a related company (revenue→CUSTOMER, cost→SUPPLIER) additionally resolve or create that company via the same FMP/Yahoo pipeline as link-counterparty (`GetOrCreateCompanyAsync`) and create a reciprocal mirror row on it (`EnsureReciprocal`) — i.e. the relationship is saved bidirectionally. Returns `{ saved, links }` (rows saved, reciprocal links created). Responses: 200 OK; 400 (CompanyId missing); 404 (company not found) |

---

## /extraction/measure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | Measure |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("measure")]` |
| View | Views/Extraction/Measure.cshtml |
| Parameters | companyId: long? (query, optional); accession: string? (query, optional); doc: string? (query, optional); form: string? (query, optional — SEC form type, e.g. `10-K`) — when companyId, accession and doc are all supplied the view model's `Targets` textarea is prefilled with a single target line `companyId, accession, doc[, form]`, otherwise the page renders an empty `MeasureViewModel` |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` (class-level — any authenticated user) |
| Notes | The form only — reached blank from the URL, or deep-linked from the "MEASURE AGENT →" button in a company's COST SOURCES section (Views/Companies/Details.cshtml) — that button reuses the existing "extract from filings" filing-picker modal (`js-extract-filings` plus `data-measure="1"`) and, in measure mode, navigates to `/extraction/measure?companyId=…&accession=…&doc=…[&form=…]` instead of POSTing a real scan, so the chosen filing arrives prefilled as a target line and the accession/doc never have to be copied by hand; more lines can still be added before running. The page no longer POSTs to this URL: the blocking `POST /extraction/measure` (which held the request open for the minutes the batch takes) is gone, replaced by the detached `measure/start` + `measure/status` + `measure/result` trio, so the "Run measurement" button starts a job and the page shows a live per-run tracker instead. READ-ONLY — persists nothing to the database. ViewModel: `MeasureViewModel` |

---

## /extraction/measure/start

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | MeasureStart (async) |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("measure/start")]` (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ jobId }`) |
| Parameters | JSON body (`MeasureViewModel`) — targets: string? (one filing per line, `companyId, accession, doc[, form]`), runs: int (clamped to 2–20) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` (class-level — any authenticated user); also requires the user's configured parsing-provider API key (`RequireParsingKey`, else `MissingApiKeyException`) |
| Notes | Detached, like `scan-auto-async` — the batch runs for minutes, so holding the request open would leave the page nothing to show and would die to any proxy timeout. Parses the target lines, registers a `MeasureJob` in the singleton in-memory `MeasureJobStore` (Services/Extraction/Measurement/MeasureJobStore.cs), fires the run on a background `Task` with its OWN DI scope (the request scope and its DbContext are gone the moment this returns, and the user's API keys are snapshotted onto the new scope), and returns the `jobId` at once for the tracker to poll. Malformed target lines are skipped and a single filing's failure is caught per-line and recorded as a `failed` row rather than voiding the batch. READ-ONLY — persists nothing to the database. Responses: 200 OK (`{ jobId }`); 400 (no valid target lines) |

---

## /extraction/measure/status/{jobId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | MeasureStatus |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("measure/status/{jobId}")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ status, error, runs: [{ filing, run, phase, workerItems, errors, leadItems, chunksTotal, chunksDone, chunks: [{ titles, status, found }] }] }`) |
| Parameters | jobId: string (route) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` (class-level — any authenticated user) |
| Notes | Polled ~1s by the live tracker on Views/Extraction/Measure.cshtml, which draws one block per (filing, run): the fast-worker chunk tree (each chunk's titles, status and found-count, plus a done/total progress figure) and then the lead agent's item count once its call lands. Kept deliberately cheap — the status DTO carries counts and titles only, never evidence text or the finished rows. The tracker redirects to `measure/result/{jobId}` on `status === "Done"` and stops on `"Error"`. Responses: 200 OK; 404 (unknown jobId) |

---

## /extraction/measure/result/{jobId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | MeasureResult |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("measure/result/{jobId}")]` |
| View | Views/Extraction/Measure.cshtml (same view as the form, rendered with the finished `MeasureViewModel`) |
| Parameters | jobId: string (route) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` (class-level — any authenticated user) |
| Notes | The finished batch for the COST extraction lead agent: (a) a per-filing summary table (chunks, worker candidates, mean items/run, retention %, repeatability %, evidence presence %) and (b) one CSV result sheet (built client-side from the job's `RowsJson`, one row per filing+run+item) carrying a blank `judgement` column for the manual precision pass; the CSV downloads from a Blob, so there is no download endpoint. A GET on purpose, so the results page can be reloaded, linked and kept open while the annotations are made. READ-ONLY. Responses: 200 OK; 404 (unknown jobId). ViewModel: `MeasureViewModel` |

---

## /extraction/auto-extract/{companyId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | AutoExtract |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("auto-extract/{companyId:long}")]` |
| View | — (JSON source suggestions for the human to confirm) |
| Parameters | companyId: long (route, constrained); accession: string (query, required); doc: string (query, required); node: string (query, required — `REVENUE`\|`COST`\|`RISK`) |
| Notes | Mode B — AI (`IFastWorkerScanService`) reads one SEC filing and proposes rows + their proof for the active node (revenue / cost / company-risk) for the human to confirm; persists nothing (the page fills the form and the existing save path freezes proof). Responses: 200 OK; 400 (missing accession/doc); 404 (no such company); 503 (Claude unreachable) |

---

## /extraction/scan-auto/{companyId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | ScanAuto |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("scan-auto/{companyId:long}")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ scanned, found }`) |
| Parameters | companyId: long (route, constrained); accession: string (query, required); doc: string (query, required); node: string (query, required — `REVENUE`\|`COST`\|`RISK`) |
| Notes | Mode B (auto) — plans deterministic filing chunks, scans them in parallel, and stores the fast-worker digest for the lead agent; persists nothing to the DB. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (missing accession/doc or invalid node); 404 (no such company); 503 (AI provider or SEC unreachable) |

---

## /extraction/scan-auto-async/{companyId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | RunFastWorkerScanAsync |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("scan-auto-async/{companyId:long}")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ jobId }`) |
| Parameters | companyId: long (route, constrained); accession: string (query, required); doc: string (query, required); node: string (query, required — `REVENUE`\|`COST`\|`RISK`); form: string? (query string, optional display metadata); companyName: string? (query string, optional); filingLabel: string? (query string, optional) |
| Notes | Mode B (async) — same scan as `scan-auto`, but detached: registers a background `ScanJob` in the in-memory `ScanJobStore`, fires the scan + an auto AI-summary chat turn on a background task (own DI scope), and returns the `jobId` at once so the page doesn't block. The user can navigate away; the global notification widget polls `scan-jobs` for the result. Persists nothing to the DB. Responses: 200 OK (`{ jobId }`); 400 (missing accession/doc); 404 (no such company) |

---

## /extraction/scan-jobs

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | ScanJobs |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("scan-jobs")]` |
| View | — (JSON array of jobs: `{ id, status, companyId, companyName, accession, doc, node, form, filingLabel, found, summary, error, replying }`) |
| Parameters | ids: string? (query string — comma-separated job ids the browser is tracking) |
| Notes | Returns the status/found-count/AI summary of the background jobs whose ids the browser holds (in localStorage). Resolves each id against both the `ScanJobStore` and the `RediscoverJobStore`, MERGING filing-scan and private-company re-discovery jobs into one list — each entry carries a `kind` (`"scan"` or `"rediscover"`) so the widget can tell a chat-capable scan from a fire-and-forget re-discovery. Unknown/dismissed ids are skipped. Backs the global bottom-right notification widget, which shows the summary and links back to `/extraction` to save the yielded objects |

---

## /extraction/scan-jobs/{jobId}/chunk/{index}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | ScanJobChunk |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("scan-jobs/{jobId}/chunk/{index:int}")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ titles, status, found, prompt, response }`) |
| Parameters | jobId: string (route); index: int (route, constrained — the chunk's position in the job's flat `ChunkList`, i.e. the `idx` the status DTO hands the widget) |
| Notes | "Under the hood" inspector for one worker agent: the verbatim prompt it saw (system + user) and its raw reply. Fetched lazily when the user expands a chunk row in the notification widget, so the heavy excerpt text never rides the 2s status poll. Responses: 200 OK; 404 (unknown job, or index out of range) |

---

## /extraction/scan-jobs/dismiss/{jobId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | DismissScanJob |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("scan-jobs/dismiss/{jobId}")]` |
| View | — (200 OK, no body) |
| Parameters | jobId: string (route) |
| Notes | Removes a job when the user dismisses it in the notification widget — clears the id from both the `ScanJobStore` and the `RediscoverJobStore`, so it dismisses filing-scan and re-discovery jobs alike |

---

## /extraction/scan-jobs/{jobId}/reply

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | ScanJobReply |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("scan-jobs/{jobId}/reply")]` |
| View | — (200 OK, no body) |
| Parameters | jobId: string (route); JSON body — { messages:[{role,content}] } (the conversation so far) |
| Notes | Starts a DETACHED background chat reply for a finished scan job so the answer survives the user navigating away. The reply is generated on a background task (own DI scope) via `IExtractionChatService.StreamReplyAsync`, streamed into the job's `ReplyBuffer`/`ReplyThink`. Responses: 200 OK on start; 404 (unknown job); 400 (scan not finished); 409 (a reply is already in progress) |

---

## /extraction/scan-jobs/{jobId}/reply (GET)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | ScanJobReplyState |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("scan-jobs/{jobId}/reply")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ replying, reply, think, error }`) |
| Parameters | jobId: string (route) |
| Notes | Polled by the notification widget to mirror the in-flight reply. Responses: 200 OK; 404 (unknown job) |

---

## /extraction/discover-related

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | DiscoverRelated |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("discover-related")]` |
| View | — (JSON array of CounterpartySuggestion) |
| Parameters | req: DiscoverCounterpartiesRequest (body) — { companyId, side (`CUSTOMER`=revenue \| `SUPPLIER`=cost), segments:[] (empty => the model identifies the company's segments itself) }; ct: CancellationToken |
| Notes | Web-search discovery via Perplexity `sonar-pro` — finds the named suppliers/customers behind a company's segments; persists nothing (the page lists them, the user confirms each via `link-counterparty`). See `docs/web_search.md`. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (missing companyId); 404 (no such company); 503 (web search unreachable) |

---

## /extraction/link-counterparty

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ExtractionController |
| Action | LinkCounterparty |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("extraction")]` + `[Route("link-counterparty")]` |
| View | — (JSON `{ sourceId, counterpartyId, node }`) |
| Parameters | req: LinkCounterpartyRequest (body) — { companyId, name, side, classification, existingCompanyId?, countryCode?, sector?, ticker?, sourceUrl?, note? } |
| Notes | Confirms one discovered counterparty: reuse (fuzzy `MatchByName`) or create the company (FMP-by-ticker, else minimal), create the `RevenueSource`/`CostSource` row with `RelatedCompanyId`, and store the sonar citation as that row's proof (the citation URL as `Reference`, sonar's note as `Evidence`). See `docs/web_search.md`. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (missing companyId/name or bad classification); 404 (no such company) |

---

## /graph

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | GraphController |
| Action | Index |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("graph")]` + `[Route("")]` |
| View | Views/Graph/Index.cshtml |
| Parameters | companyId: long? (query string, optional) |
| Notes | Renders network graph explorer with company picker; `?companyId=` selects starting center. ViewModel: `GraphIndexViewModel` (Models/ViewModels/GraphViewModels.cs) |

---

## /graph/data/company/{id}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | GraphController |
| Action | CompanyGraph |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("graph")]` + `[Route("data/company/{id:long}")]` |
| View | — (JSON `GraphResponse` record with `GraphNode`, `GraphEdge` records) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | Consumed by JS in Views/Graph/Index.cshtml; returns NotFound when company missing or soft-deleted |

---

## /impact

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ImpactController |
| Action | Index |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[Route("impact")]` + `[Route("", Name = "ImpactIndex")]` |
| View | Views/Impact/Index.cshtml |
| Parameters | — |
| Notes | The Impact Simulator page — an input-output cascade simulator. Follows the GraphController pattern: one MVC controller that both renders the interactive view and serves its JSON data action. ViewModel: none (returns `View()`) |

---

## /impact/solve

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ImpactController |
| Action | Solve |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | `[Route("impact")]` + `[Route("solve", Name = "ImpactSolve")]` |
| View | — (JSON: ranked sector impacts, per-sector companies, and a propagation trace) |
| Parameters | JSON body (`ImpactRequest`) — { kind, sector, magnitude } |
| Notes | Runs one input-output cascade (`EventImpactService.Solve`) and returns the ranked sector impacts, per-sector companies, and propagation trace. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (unknown `sector` or `kind`) |

---

## /impact/firms

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ImpactController |

| Notes | Global search backing the nav-bar command bar and the home hero search input. Returns hits grouped by Kind (Companies / Countries / Events) from `ISearchService.Search`. JSON only, no Razor view |

---

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | StockController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | Resolve |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/stock")]` + `[HttpGet("resolve/{ticker}")]` |

| Parameters | ticker: string (route) |
| Notes | Read-only ticker -> CIK lookup. Returns 200 OK or 404 if the ticker is unknown |

---

## api/stock/filings/{companyId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | StockController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | Filings |
| HTTP | GET |

| Parameters | companyId: long (route, constrained) |
| Notes | Read-only; built from SEC submissions `filings.recent`; each row includes a ready-to-open sec.gov Archives documentUrl. Responses: 200 OK; 404; 409 (no CIK); 422 (no filings); 503 |

---

## api/stock/filing/{companyId}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | StockController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | Filing |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/stock")]` + `[HttpGet("filing/{companyId:long}")]` |
| View | — (the filing's primary document text, returned as text/plain) |
| Parameters | companyId: long (route, constrained); accession: string (query, required); doc: string (query, required) |
| Notes | Read-only proxy of one filing document from sec.gov Archives so its text can be selected as proof in /extraction. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (missing accession/doc); 404 (no company / document not found); 409 (no CIK); 503 |

---

## api/companies/{id}/volume

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompaniesController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | GetVolume |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/[controller]")]` + `[HttpGet("{id:long}/volume")]` |
| View | — (JSON array of `{ weekStart, volume }`) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` class-level (cookie or the MCP API-key scheme) |
| Notes | Read-only stored weekly trading-volume series (no SEC/Yahoo call — just persisted rows via `GetVolumeHistory`). Added for the read-only MCP server's `get_stock_volume` tool; the ingest path that fills it stays a separate Admin/Manager POST on the MVC `CompaniesController` (`/companies/{id}/ingest-volume`). Returns 404 when the company is not found |

---

## api/CompanyRisks

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompanyRisksController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | GetAll / GetById / Create / Update / Delete |
| HTTP | GET /api/CompanyRisks (`?q=` optional search), GET /api/CompanyRisks/{id:long}, POST /api/CompanyRisks, PUT /api/CompanyRisks/{id:long}, DELETE /api/CompanyRisks/{id:long} |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/[controller]")]` |
| View | — (JSON `CompanyRiskDto` / list) |
| Parameters | q: string? (query, GetAll); id: long (route, constrained); body: `CompanyRiskRequestDto` (Create/Update) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` class-level (GET); `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` on Create/Update/Delete |
| Notes | Standard CRUD; Delete is a soft-delete (`_repo.SoftDelete`) |

---

## api/CompanyFinancials

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | CompanyFinancialsController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | GetAll / GetById / Create / Update / Delete |
| HTTP | GET /api/CompanyFinancials (`?q=` optional search), GET /api/CompanyFinancials/{id:long}, POST /api/CompanyFinancials, PUT /api/CompanyFinancials/{id:long}, DELETE /api/CompanyFinancials/{id:long} |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/[controller]")]` |
| View | — (JSON `CompanyFinancialDto` / list) |
| Parameters | q: string? (query, GetAll); id: long (route, constrained); body: `CompanyFinancialRequestDto` (Create/Update) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` class-level (GET); `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` on Create/Update/Delete |
| Notes | Standard CRUD; Delete is a soft-delete (`_repo.SoftDelete`) |

---

## api/Filings

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | FilingsController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | GetAll / GetById / Create / Update / Delete |
| HTTP | GET /api/Filings (`?q=` optional search), GET /api/Filings/{id:long}, POST /api/Filings, PUT /api/Filings/{id:long}, DELETE /api/Filings/{id:long} |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/[controller]")]` |
| View | — (JSON `FilingDto` / list) |
| Parameters | q: string? (query, GetAll); id: long (route, constrained); body: `FilingRequestDto` (Create/Update) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` class-level (GET); `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` on Create/Update/Delete |
| Notes | Standard CRUD, except Create calls `_repo.Upsert(companyId, accessionNumber, form, filingDate, primaryDocUrl)` instead of a plain insert — AccessionNumber has a unique index, so an existing row for the same accession is revived/refreshed rather than colliding. Delete is a soft-delete (`_repo.SoftDelete`) |

---

## api/Filings/{id}/document

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | FilingsController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | Document |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/[controller]")]` + `[HttpGet("{id:long}/document")]` |
| View | — (the filing's primary document markup, returned as text/plain) |
| Parameters | id: long (route, constrained) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` class-level (any authenticated user — no role restriction, unlike Create/Update/Delete) |
| Notes | Read-only proxy of the stored filing's primary document from sec.gov Archives — the document file name comes from `Filing.PrimaryDocUrl` (its last path segment) and the CIK from the owning company; it reads/writes the same `IMemoryCache` entry (`FastWorkerScanService.RawKey`) the extraction scan pipeline uses, so an already-scanned filing is served without a second SEC call. Backs the in-app evidence viewer (wwwroot/js/evidence.js), which opens the filing scrolled to the verbatim quote stored on a revenue/cost/risk row. Responses: 200 OK; 404 (no filing / document not found); 409 (filing has no PrimaryDocUrl, or company has no CIK); 503 (SEC unreachable) |

---

## api/Scenarios

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ScenariosController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | GetAll / GetById / Create / Update / Delete |

| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/[controller]")]` |
| View | — (JSON `ScenarioDto` / list — includes nested `Shocks: List<ScenarioShockDto>`) |
| Parameters | q: string? (query, GetAll); id: long (route, constrained); body: `ScenarioRequestDto` (Create/Update) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` class-level (GET); `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` on Create/Update/Delete |
| Notes | Standard CRUD; Delete is a soft-delete (`_repo.SoftDelete`). `ScenarioDto` carries the scenario's `ScenarioShock` rows nested under `Shocks` |

---

## api/ScenarioShocks

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | ScenarioShocksController (Controllers/Api/) |
| Action | GetAll / GetById / Create / Update / Delete |
| HTTP | GET /api/ScenarioShocks (`?q=` optional search), GET /api/ScenarioShocks/{id:long}, POST /api/ScenarioShocks, PUT /api/ScenarioShocks/{id:long}, DELETE /api/ScenarioShocks/{id:long} |
| Route source | `[ApiController]` + `[Route("api/[controller]")]` |
| View | — (JSON `ScenarioShockDto` / list) |
| Parameters | q: string? (query, GetAll); id: long (route, constrained); body: `ScenarioShockRequestDto` (Create/Update) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` class-level (GET); `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]` on Create/Update/Delete |
| Notes | Standard CRUD, except Delete is a HARD delete (`db.ScenarioShocks.Remove` via `_repo.Delete`) — ScenarioShock has no `DeletedAt` column |

---

## /Account/Profile

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | AccountController |
| Action | Profile |

| Notes | AJAX metadata for the current profile picture, consumed by the Profile page's Dropzone to render the existing file. Returns `{ hasPicture: false }` (not 404) when there's no picture |

---

## /Account/UploadProfilePicture

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | AccountController |
| Action | UploadProfilePicture |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | Convention (`/{controller}/{action}/{id?}`) (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (JSON `{ path, name, size }`) |
| Parameters | file: IFormFile (Dropzone field name "file") |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` (any authenticated user) |
| Notes | Dropzone upload — saves to `wwwroot/uploads/profiles/{userId}/{guid}{ext}`, records metadata on `AppUser`, and replaces any existing picture. Validates JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP only and a 5 MB limit. Responses: 200 OK; 400 (no file / over limit / disallowed type) |

---

## /Account/DeleteProfilePicture

| Field | Value |

---

## /Account/ApiKeys

| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | Convention (`/{controller}/{action}/{id?}`) |
| View | Views/Account/ApiKeys.cshtml |
| Parameters | — |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` (any authenticated user) |
| Notes | Bring-your-own API keys management page — the signed-in user's own DeepSeek / FMP / Perplexity keys, stored encrypted (Data Protection) in `UserApiKeys`. Shows only "set · ••••last4" status, never the raw key. Linked from the user dropdown nav in Views/Shared/_LoginPartial.cshtml. ViewModel: `ApiKeysViewModel` |

---

## /Account/SaveApiKeys

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | AccountController |
| Action | SaveApiKeys |

| Route source | Convention (`/{controller}/{action}/{id?}`) (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | — (redirects to ApiKeys) |
| Parameters | deepSeekKey: string?; fmpKey: string?; perplexityKey: string? (form); clearDeepSeek/clearFmp/clearPerplexity: bool (form) |
| Auth | `[Authorize]` (any authenticated user) |
| Notes | Saves the user's encrypted API keys to `UserApiKeys`. Per key: a "clear" tick removes it; a non-blank input sets it (encrypted); blank leaves it as-is (so one key can be updated without re-typing the others). Redirects back to ApiKeys |

---

## /Admin

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | AdminController |
| Action | Index |
| HTTP | GET |
| Route source | Convention (`/{controller}/{action}/{id?}`, defaults action Index) |
| View | Views/Admin/Index.cshtml |
| Parameters | — |

---

## /Admin/EditRoles

|---|---|
| Controller | AdminController |
| Action | EditRoles |
| HTTP | GET, POST |
| Route source | Convention (`/{controller}/{action}/{id?}`) (POST is ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |
| View | Views/Admin/EditRoles.cshtml |
| Parameters | GET: userId: string (query); POST: `EditRolesViewModel` (form) |
| Auth | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` |
| Notes | Role-assignment form for one user — GET renders a checkbox per role; POST diffs current vs selected and only adds/removes the roles that changed, then redirects to Index. 404 when the user id is unknown |

---

## /Admin/Delete

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Controller | AdminController |
| Action | Delete |
| HTTP | POST |
| Route source | Convention (`/{controller}/{action}/{id?}`) (ValidateAntiForgeryToken) |

| Notes | The built-in Identity UI — `/Identity/Account/Register`, `/Identity/Account/Login`, `/Identity/Account/Logout`, `/Identity/Account/ExternalLogin` (Google sign-in), and the other default account pages |

---

## Authorization model

ASP.NET Core Identity now gates the existing controllers as follows:

- **MVC entity controllers** (Countries, Companies, Events, TradeBlocs, CountryDetails, CountryAdvantages, CountryChallenges, GdpSnapshots, RevenueSources, CostSources, Indices): read GETs (`Index`/`Search`/`Details`/`Lookup`/`ValidateCountry` and the like) are `[AllowAnonymous]`; `Create`/`Edit`/`Delete` (and the other mutating actions) require `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]`.
- **API controllers** (Controllers/Api — GraphController, StockController, CompanyRisks, CompanyFinancials, Filings, Scenarios, ScenarioShocks): `GET` requires `[Authorize]` (any authenticated user); `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` require `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]`.
- **Public** (no auth): Home, Ticker, Graph, Impact.
- **ExtractionController**: `[Authorize]` for the whole controller — ANY authenticated user. The keyed AI features run on the user's own stored API keys (bring-your-own), so a signed-in customer can use them without a role; a missing key surfaces the "add your key" popup instead of a 403. The reviewer role is applied per-write instead of per-controller: `IsReviewer` (Admin or Manager) decides whether a saved row goes live (Approved) or is held as a Pending contribution.
- **AccountController**: `[Authorize]` (any authenticated user).
- **AdminController**: `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`.
